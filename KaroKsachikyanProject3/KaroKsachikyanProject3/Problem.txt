Project 3 - Egg Drop Problem
Problem Statement â€“ You have i light bulbs (or any other fragile item) and a tower with n increasing height windows. 
Assume you want to experimentally determine the highest window where you can safely drop a bulb. You can drop a bulb out of any window. 
If it breaks, you have one less bulb. If it does not break, you can retrieve the bulb and use it again. There are many possible ways to solve the problem.
Your goal, for given values of i and n, is to determine the worst case minimum number of drops using 
DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.

This program is a solution to the egg drop problem using dynamic programming. It uses a 2d array to store values that
correspond to the number of drops required to conclude whether an egg will break if dropped from a given height.
